### Assumption 1
* When Athos studies the affinity of a country to a beer style, there might be missing data. In this case, the draw is made on a uniform score distribution. This means that the probability of obtaining the score $$[i]$$ is the same for all scores.

* $$\quad$$Because of the lack of datas, Les4Mousquetaires considered that this simulation follows a pattern according the datas between 2004 and 2017. For step 2, they decided to weight the consumption variation rate with a random coefficient drawn from the beers ratings distribution to better simulate the unpredicability of the beer's world market.
